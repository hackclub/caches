# üìÄ 14/09 Update ~ Hack Club Caches 

These updates & the headings used are based on feedback on [the initial proposal](/README.md).  

## ü™¢ Tie-In to Tech

- **Laser cutting & 2D design:** the process of manufacturing & design-technology skills picked up are documented using GitHub with Hack Clubbers being able to contribute through PRs.
- **Ciphers & puzzles:** each cache shipped to Hack Clubbers is covered in cryptic codes that Hack Clubbers (either in the present or the future) can crack together. Again, will also be open sourced.
- **Artifacts of hacker culture:** Hack Clubbers will stuff the caches with items relevant to what they‚Äôre building today and technology topics that interest them at the moment.

## üìÖ Achievable in Three Months

To make this happen in three months, the following timeline will be used:

- By October 20th: kits ready, marketing materials ready & interest form live.
- By November 1st: begin shipping kits to Hack Clubbers.
- By December 1st: fifty kits shipped out from Singapore.
- By December 31st: all kits shipped & project transitions to maintenance mode.

## üó∫Ô∏è Discoverability

> hone in on if it's a time capsule or discoverables now (because these have different goals)

Having thought about this a bit more, I'd like to position these caches as "vaults". Hack Clubbers bury the original cache and the location is made available immediately (the approximate location with a hint to find the actual cache!). Then, as time unfolds, Hack Clubbers can flock to these caches to rediscover what Hack Clubbers have previously placed in them and then add their own items. Over time, these caches will become a journey through time!

## üõ†Ô∏è Hacker Interaction

Hackers will interact with these caches in the following way (in the inital three months period):

- Able to contribute to the designs, copy & puzzles through GitHub.
- Will meetup to assemble the cache kits when they arrive to create a 3D structure.
- Will meetup to stuff the cache with trinkets & curiosities.
