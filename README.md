# 📀 Hack Club Caches

**The TLDR:** Historic caches of hacker culture in the 2020s, placed around the world by Hack Clubbers.

We've got thousands of Hack Clubbers [all around the world](https://som-mail-system.hackclub.com), all [shipping](https://hackclub.com/ship) exciting projects & creating the internet age. **📀 Hack Club Caches** will create an artifact of this time. 

## 🎯 Goals

The goals of the project are as follows:

👋 **Bring Hack Clubbers together.** Hack Clubbers meetup to construct & hide/bury a Hack Club Cache, bringing the magic of the Slack into real life. 

📜 **Documenting the process of creating the caches.** For example, documenting learning how to use the laser cutter & doing it on the fly to enable fellow Hack Clubbers to contribute to process.

🧑‍💻 **Hack Clubbers contribute to the Caches.** The details of these are still up in the art, but, Hack Clubbers should be able to make these Caches their own. One way this will happen, is that they'll stuff the Caches with their own special items!

📀 **Create a relic of Hack Club that can be explored years later.** Imagine a world twenty or, even, fourty years later, where the Hack Clubbers of that age dig up a Cache.

## 📝 Implementation

To make these Caches happen, we'll do the following:

1. Design a kit to construct a Cache (flat-pack laser cut wooden pieces).
2. Create a marketing website & hype around the Caches (including a sign-up process).
3. Ship out the kits to Hack Clubbers around the world.
4. Hack Clubbers recieve the kits & meetup to construct the kits (they place items of interest in the Cache). 
5. The Cache gets buried! The exact location & a hint to find the Cache.

3. 2. 1. Hack!
